                    <strong>Lovee,</strong>
                    Happy Valentine's Day my Lovee. It's been 2 years already since we met,
                    I am always grateful that you're the one who came into my life — that
                    you are my partner in everything. It's literally "kung hindi ikaw 'wag na",
                    I want to spend the rest of my life with you — build a life with you and a family.
                    Even we face so many ups and downs in life/relationship, I will always choose you —
                    choose us. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We don't know what the future holds, but I wish the best for the both of us love.
                    May our paths lead us to success — to our goals and dreams, not just for our 
                    relationship but also for our families too. Good luck on our OJT love, may this
                    opportunity gave us a fresh start for our future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Lastly love, I really want to apologize about our Valentines this year, I didn't want
                    it to be like this, that it wasn't like before. I will make it up with you love, like 
                    I always do.
                    <br>
